Next steps:

- Add ability for user to provide feedback on plans using `<feedback>` tags.
- Flesh out the research work a bit more. Ideally it should guide the agent to reserach the internet for techniques if appropriate. This should be verified with the programmer. 
- Audit all of the commands/agents to ensure they are using the latest best practices for prompting Claude and limiting context bloat.
- Switch to using opus for all agents/commands.
