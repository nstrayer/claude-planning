Next steps:

- Be smarter about detecting what a plan is. E.g. a format in the header that can be checked and the create plan command can generate.
- Add ability to copy command and plan path to the clipboard for easy use in claude. E.g. copy `/bootandshoe:iterate_plan /path/to/plan.md` to clipboard.
- Look into making the IDs for the feedback more human-readable. Potentially using a small llm to generate meaningful names based on the area and content of the feedback.
